                <h1>Delhi</h1>
                <p>Delhi is both a union territory within India, as well as a city, and features two very different worlds: New Delhi and Old Delhi. The former, inaugurated by the British in 1931 to serve as the imperial capital, is the nation's modern capital and seat of government, while Old Delhi is considered by many as the symbolic heart of the greater metropolitan area.

                    One of the most populous regions in the world – it boasts a population of nearly 20 million people – Delhi is a heady mix of tradition and modernity, and is important as both a religious center and India's busiest international gateway. Its history is as old as the ancient Yamuna River, one of the most sacred rivers in Hinduism and a natural dividing line between New Delhi to the west and Old Delhi to the east.</p>
